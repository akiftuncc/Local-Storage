          I have developed a website that includes a table where users can add
          their information. This table serves as a data collection tool. The
          website is built using <span>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          When a user enters their information into the table, such as their
          name, age, and email address, JavaScript is used to capture and store
          this data locally on the user's device. <span>Local storage</span> is
          a web browser feature that allows web applications to store data on
          the user's device. It provides a way to persistently store data even
          when the user refreshes or closes the website.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          By utilizing local storage, the user's data can be saved and retrieved
          whenever they visit the website again. This means that even if the
          user closes the browser or restarts their device, their
          <span>previously entered information</span> will still be available in
          the table.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Overall, this project combines the use of HTML for structuring the web
          page, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for capturing and
          storing user data in the local storage of their device.
